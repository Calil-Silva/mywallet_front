## About the project

This project was built with with React.js using Creat React App. It is a ``financial schedule``, where user can ``register`` his incomes, expanses and see the final balance.

### Motivation

My motivation to create this project was to organize and record day by day financial events in a simple and fast way. In the near future, I will also implement more features like geolocation, edit values and the possibility to check events by selecting a specific month.

### Usage

As a user, you will have to register an account with an e-mail and a password in the ``Sign up`` page and then you can go to ``Sign in`` page, put your credentials and enjoy the features above. After the credentials are valid and user is signed in, his options are see his ``balance``, ``add new debit`` and ``add new credit``.

Below you can see a demonstration of how it works and a link to access the application in real time.
